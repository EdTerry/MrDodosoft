Privacy Policy

Introduction

This is the Privacy Policy of Mr. Dodosoft (http://mrdodosoft.com). In this Privacy Policy, I (Mr. Dodosoft) refer to my applications and services as the “Application.” Please read on to learn more about my data handling practices. Your use of the Application signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Application.

Information I collect

When you install Application on your device I collect the following types of information from you:

Geolocation. I collect information from your device about your location (“Geolocation Information“). Currently, I only use Geolocation Information for routing optimization and user-search optimization on my messaging platform, as well as for general analytics.

Device information. Application collects information about your device that enables me to verify your identity.

Application may also collect and gather personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information including age, gender, preferences and publicly-available profiles on other applications (for example your name, email address, and profile pictures).

Application may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the other members, text messages, usage, statistics on page views.

Application may collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you create on the Application.

By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). I am not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.

Currently, the Application does not offer tools that allow you to opt-out of the collection of Personal Information.

Information collected when the App logs into Facebook allowing users to share their score is used only for the purpose of allowing the use to share their score on their Facebook feed.

The App requests camera permissions (‘android.permission.CAMERA’) used for permissions that are associated with accessing camera or capturing images/video from the device.

This permission allows this application to stream a live feed onto a 3D surface, allowing the user experience simulated augmented reality through their mobile device.

 

Sharing of your information

I will not trade, rent or sell your information to third parties.

Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Application, such as User Content, becomes available to the public. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.

Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Application maintains facilities. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing data as described in this Privacy Policy, I reserve the right to transfer information outside of your country. By using the Application, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

In addition, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and related technology, I do not guarantee the protection of information under my control against loss, misuse or alteration.

How I use information I collect

I use or may disclose your personal information only as follows:

To connect you with others as enabled by the Application;
To share your Profile with others on the Application;
To show you the names of persons you communicate with and to show your name to persons you communicate with on the Application;
To deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Application;
To provide you with relevant content that you requested, using information that you allow me to collect from you or that you provide to a social media provider with which your Application account is connected, such as information regarding your and your Application contacts' respective locations;
For internal operations, including troubleshooting problems, data analysis, testing, research, improvements to the Application, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other illegal activity;
When I have a good faith belief that the law, any legal process, law enforcement, national security or issue of public importance requires disclosure;
To protect and defend my rights or property;
In connection with a corporate transaction involving Application, such as the purchase or sale of a business unit, an acquisition, merger, sale of assets, or other similar event.
Third party links

Occasionally, at my discretion, I may include or offer third party products or services in my applications. These third party services have separate and independent privacy policies. I therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked applications. Nonetheless, I seek to protect the integrity of my applications and welcome any feedback about these applications.

Age

The Application is directed towards people over the age of thirteen (13) and I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of eighteen as part of the Application. If I become aware that I have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Application, I will delete such information from my records.

Notification of Changes

I reserve the right at my discretion to make changes to this Privacy Policy. You may review updates to my Privacy Policy at any time via links on Google Play account. I reserve the right to modify this policy from time to time, so please review it frequently.

If I make material changes to this policy, I will notify you by publishing a revised Privacy Policy or as required by law. You agree to review the Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. You agree that your continued use of the Application after I publish a revised Privacy Policy or provide a notice on my applications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of the Privacy Policy, you should not use the Application.
